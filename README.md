Crypto Random Private Keys Generator

A lightweight Python tool that generates BIP-39 compliant 12-word mnemonic phrases using secure randomness.
t ensures strong cryptographic entropy and an accurate checksum for each mnemonic, replicating the same logic
used in wallets like Ledger or MetaMask.

Real-Life Use

This tool can be used to understand how wallet seed phrases are generated, test key generation systems
or integrate secure mnemonic creation in blockchain projects
Itâ€™s designed for developers who want full transparency into how private key entropy and mnemonic encoding work behind the scenes.

How to Use

Clone or download this script
Run it using Python 3.7+

python main.py

The output will be a valid 12-word BIP-39 mnemonic phrase
